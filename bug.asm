mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4] ; This instruction assumes that ecx is a valid index into the array pointed to by ebx. If ecx is too large, it will result in an access violation.

mov eax, [ebx+ecx*8] ;This instruction assumes that the array pointed to by ebx contains 64-bit integers. If it actually contains 32-bit integers, it will result in an access violation or unexpected behavior.

mov eax, [ebx-ecx*4] ;This instruction attempts to access memory before the start of the array. This can also result in an access violation or unexpected behavior.

mov eax, [ebx] ; The code assumes that ebx holds a valid memory address. If ebx holds an invalid address, it will result in an access violation.
